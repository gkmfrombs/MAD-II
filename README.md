## [Quick Ride](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L3Qx4R8dMDgK6Hl35nk6q4peHu56esSq/view?usp=sharing)

Here's a clean, quick-start README template for your Library Management System project, built with Vue.js and Flask. You can paste this as README.md and customize as needed.

# Library Management System

A lightweight, full-stack web application for managing library operations. Built with a Vue.js frontend and a Flask backend.

- Tech stack: Vue.js (frontend), Flask (backend), RESTful API
- Features: catalog/search, book checkout/return, user management, borrowing history, admin controls

---



## Demo

Provide a short note or link to a live demo if available.  
Example: https://your-domain.com or http://localhost:5173 (during local development)

---

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Browse and search the book catalog
- Check out and return books
- View borrowing history and due dates
- Admin dashboards for book and user management
- Responsive UI with Vue.js

---

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Vue.js 3, Vue Router, Vuex (or Pinia), Axios
- Backend: Flask, SQLAlchemy (or your ORM), SQLite/PostgreSQL
- API: RESTful endpoints (JSON)
- Authentication: JWT (or Flask-Login + JWT)
- Optional: Docker

---



Notes:
- Adjust paths if you place frontend and backend in different structures.
- If using Docker, you can add docker-compose.yml in the root.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 14
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment tool (venv) or conda
- PostgreSQL or SQLite (depending on your setup)
- (Optional) Docker and Docker Compose

### Backend Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - macOS/Linux:
     - python3 -m venv venv
     - source venv/bin/activate
   - Windows:
     - py -m venv venv
     - venv\Scripts\activate

2. Install dependencies:
   - For Flask: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`

3. Set up the database (example with SQLite):
   - Ensure database configuration in `backend/config.py` is correct.
   - Run migrations or initialize the DB as per your setup.

4. Run the Flask server:
   - `cd backend`
   - `export FLASK_APP=app.py` (or set the env variable as appropriate)
   - `flask run` (default: http://127.0.0.1:5000)

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to frontend:
   - `cd frontend`

2. Install dependencies:
   - `npm install` (or `pnpm install` / `yarn install` if you prefer)

3. Run the Vue dev server:
   - `npm run serve` (or the exact command in your project, e.g., `npm run dev`)

4. Ensure the frontend is configured to talk to your backend API (CORS and API base URL).

### Run Locally (Full-stack)

- Start backend (Flask) first.
- Then start frontend (Vue) and ensure API calls reach the backend (e.g., via proxy in vue.config.js or environment variables).

---

## Usage

- Register as a user or admin (depending on your roles)
- Browse the catalog, search by title/author/subject
- Check out books, view due dates and history
- Admins can add/edit/delete books, manage users, and review borrowing logs
